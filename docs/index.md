# QField API documentation

## Introduction

[QField](https://qfield.org) focuses on efficiently getting GIS fieldwork
done and exchanging data between the field and the office in a comfortable
and user-friendly way. QField runs on Android and iOS as well as Linux,
macOS, and Windows.

Built on top of the popular QGIS open-source project, QField lets users
consume fully configured projects in the field, allowing for customized
feature forms, map themes, print layouts, and more, bringing the power of
QGIS to your fingertips.

Leveraging open source libraries such as gdal, SQLite and PostGIS, QField
reads, displays and allows editing of a wide variety of spatial vector and
raster datasets. Users can view and modify datasets wherever they are,
whether they have been downloaded onto your device, shared in emails or
transferred via USB cable.
